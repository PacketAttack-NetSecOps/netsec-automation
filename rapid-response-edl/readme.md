Idea:

Create a web app tool that is used for managing EDL (External Dynamic Lists) for multiple firewall vendors.

Security teams can add Domains & IPs to the web app. The webapp makes URLs available to be ingested into multiple firewall vendors.
Palo Alto, Fortigate, Zscaler ZIA, etc, etc

The tool can also be used to aggregate multiple public lists to engest into the firewall.

The idea was from MineMeld, and Palo Alto utility, that was sunsetted by Cortex
